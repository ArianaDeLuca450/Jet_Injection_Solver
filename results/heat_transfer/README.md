## Test Results
The following images are used to verify the validity of the heat transfer MATLAB code. The left and bottom edges have a temperature of 0°C, while the right and top edges have a temperature of 1°C, all of which are help constant throughout the simulation. Both plates have a length of 11 x 11 units. In Abaqus, the plate was given a thermal conductivity of 15 W/m °C.

### Heat Transfer Test
The following images are the final outputs from the MATLAB code and Abaqus:
