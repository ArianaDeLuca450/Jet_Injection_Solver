# Jet_Injection_Solver
This script is a CFD-esque solver for jet injection. The first version of the code uses bilinear interpolation to solve and visualize temperature fields.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the 'BilinearInterpolation.m' file in MATLAB.

## Features
- Iterative solution for temperature fields using bilinear interpolation
- Visualizes results at each step

  ## Planned Updates
  - Incorporate velocity fields
  - Add convergence criteria for stopping
  - Extend to simulate jet injection physics
  - Run a Monte Carlo simulation to analyze how stochastic fluctuations influence turbulent mixing
